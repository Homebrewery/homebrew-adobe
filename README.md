==================
Homebrew _[tap]_ for [Adobe] apps, and even [plugins]!

Install
-------

brew tap danielbayley/adobe
brew cask install #cask
brew install #formula
~~~

[Some] [_Cask_]s rely on an [environment variable] to function, which can be set in your [shell startup file], for example: `export HOMEBREW_ADOBE_CASK=value >> ~/.bashrc`. Further information will be displayed as [`caveats`], which are always available by running `brew info cask`.

[Contribute][guide]
-------------------
